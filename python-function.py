# Functions in Python are known as "First Class"
# Unlike other traditional languages like PHP, Functions in Python are First-Class Functions. This means that they can basically go wherever they want!
#
# Functions can be stored as standalone functions
# Functions can be defined inside Classes/Instances (known as methods)
# Functions can be passed as arguments to functions (known as callbacks)
# Functions can be returned from functions (creating a closure)
# Functions can be anonymous which are stored in variables/used only one time (known as lambdas)
